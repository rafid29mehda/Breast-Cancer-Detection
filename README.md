# Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project predicts breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Seven machine learning models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy and ROC-AUC scores, with results visualized in a bar chart.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (`breast_cancer.csv`)
- **Features**: 30 numeric features (e.g., radius_mean, texture_mean)
- **Target**: `diagnosis` (M = Malignant, B = Benign)
- **Samples**: 569

## Models
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)
